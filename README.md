# Spatio-Temporal-Analysis-of-Climate-and-Road-Safety

The was analysis was part of my Mphil thesis to investigate the impact of temperature and rainfall on road crashes, fatalities and injuries in the Greater Kumasi of Ghana
The files are two: one for the initial data curation and the spatial regression with INLA package and the others holds the graphs
